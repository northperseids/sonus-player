# Sonus Audio Player
Minimal single-track audio player for sites like neocities.

This repo is just code examples. If you want to use the player you can either modify the code here or use the [automatic generator](https://neartsua.neocities.org/other-pages/sonus-player/auto).

Edit to your heart's content.

No attribution required, but is appreciated!!
